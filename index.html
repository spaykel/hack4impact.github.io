                    I am a <em>computer science</em> student at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new skills. I am <strong>passionate</strong> about creating high-quality code that follows best practices and industry standards. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a student and as a software developer.
